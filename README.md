# Library-Managment-System-Project
Our first semester project using the basic concepts of C++

so basically it is a management system which will help the librarian to manage the library.
the .txt files are the books which would be loaded into the memory on runtime
and all changes made during the program on the books will be written on the files at the end of program.
